# Approximate-Infinite-Dimensional-RCovDs
This is a demo code which contrasts the use of the conventional Regional 
Covariance Descriptors (RCovDs) against approximate infinite dimensional RCovDs obtained by the
random Fourier features and the Nystrom method. The nearest neighbour and
the kernel partial least squares classifiers are taken into account. The code is
tested on Matlab R2013a.

To see the results, run the script RunMe.m. 
The Classification accuracies will be shown in your command window.
